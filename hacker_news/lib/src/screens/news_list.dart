/// The main screen that displays a scrollable list of Hacker News stories.
///
/// This widget creates a screen with:
/// - An app bar with the title "Top News" and a refresh button
/// - A scrollable list of news stories fetched from the Hacker News API
/// - Loading indicators while stories are being downloaded
/// - Error messages with retry functionality if something goes wrong
/// - Pagination (automatic loading of more stories when you scroll down)
///
/// **How it works:**
/// 1. When the screen loads, it automatically starts downloading top stories
/// 2. As stories are downloaded, they appear in the list one by one
/// 3. When you scroll near the bottom, it automatically loads more stories
/// 4. If there's a network error, it shows an error message with a retry button
///
/// This is a **StatefulWidget**, which means it can change and update over time
/// (like when new stories are loaded or when you scroll through the list).

  /// 2. Tell our data source (StoriesBloc) to start downloading stories
  ///
  /// **Why we use addPostFrameCallback:**

  /// 80% of the way down the list, we automatically load more stories.

  /// **How it works:**
  /// - `pixels` = how far down the user has scrolled
  /// - `maxScrollExtent` = the total scrollable distance
  /// - When pixels >= 80% of maxScrollExtent, load more stories
  ///
  /// This creates a seamless "infinite scroll" experience where new content

  /// Cleans up resources when this screen is removed from memory.
  ///
  /// This is like a "cleanup" method that runs when the user navigates away
  /// from this screen. We need to dispose of the scroll controller to prevent
  /// memory leaks (where unused objects stay in memory forever).
